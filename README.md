# lucidity
an anthology of lucidrains' open source work

## huh?

lucidrains does a lot of amazing and valuable work reproducing ML research. Scattered among his model implementations are a variety of useful functions that he often defines in-line with his work because they're just a few lines. I think a lot of people would benefit from having all of these little building blocks together in one place. My plan for the moment is to just work backwards through some of the projects he's been particularly active on recently, and import the odds and ends into some sort of organization and wrap that as a package that depends directly on upstream implementation for each function.
